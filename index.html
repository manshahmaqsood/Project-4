            Parallax scrolling is a web design practice where different elements or layers of a website — such as the
            foreground and background — move at different speeds. And parallax website design is simply a web design
            that incorporates parallax scrolling. Parallax scrolling effects give a sense of depth and movement to a web
            page, thus creating a more enjoyable user experience.

            The most typical example of parallax web design is when a page’s background moves slower than its
            foreground, visually creating more space between the two. However, various other parallax scrolling
            techniques can add a special charm or an element of unpredictability to a website.

        <h2>Section Two</h2>
        <p>
            Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the
            physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of
            science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from
            other natural phenomena.

            The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or
            "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth". In ancient
            philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis, which originally
            related to the intrinsic characteristics of plants, animals, and other features of the world to develop of
            their own accord. The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of
            the original notion; it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers
            (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and has steadily gained currency
            ever since.

        <h2>Section Three</h2>
        <p>
            During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive
            reality, organized and moved by divine laws. With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly became seen
            as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention: it was hence considered as sacred by some
            traditions (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history
            (Hegel, Marx). However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the pre-Socratic one, got reborn at the same
            time, especially after Charles Darwin.

            Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to geology and wildlife. Nature can refer
            to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with
            inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the
            weather and geology of the Earth. It is often taken to mean the "natural environment" or wilderness—wild
            animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human
            intervention, or which persist despite human intervention.
